/**
 * This class serves as a WebChromeClient to be set to a WebView, allowing it to play video.
 * Video will play differently depending on target API level (in-line, fullscreen, or both).
 *
 * It has been tested with the following video classes:
 * - android.widget.VideoView (typically API level <11)
 * - android.webkit.HTML5VideoFullScreen$VideoSurfaceView/VideoTextureView (typically API level 11-18)
 * - com.android.org.chromium.content.browser.ContentVideoView$VideoSurfaceView (typically API level 19+)
 *
 * Important notes:
 * - For API level 11+, android:hardwareAccelerated="true" must be set in the application manifest.
 * - The invoking activity must call VideoEnabledWebChromeClient's onBackPressed() inside of its own onBackPressed().
 * - Tested in Android API levels 8-19. Only tested on http://m.youtube.com.
